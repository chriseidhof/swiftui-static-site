# The Worst Static Site Generator In The World

One of the best thing about static site generators is that they run in the terminal. Also, you can easily build your own with no or few dependencies.

This static site generator has a *massive* dependency on SwiftUI and can't run without it.

It uses SwiftUI's incremental updates to build a static site (once from scratch) and then observes file changes, only writing the files that need it.
